            <p>Once upon a time, three little pigs were told by their mother that she didn't have enough food or resourses to keep taking care of them. She told them to each go out and try to make it on their own. The three pigs found a nice spot to build their homes and got to work. The first pig, 
                the youngest, decided to build his house out of straw because he thought it was the easiest and fastest way and knew he would have more time to play. The second pig, the middle, decided to build his house out of wood. His house took a little longer to build and was sturdier than the 
                first pig's house but still was not super sturdy. The last pig, the oldest, decided to build his house out of bricks. This house took him a very long time and he had to watch his brothers play while he worked, but he knew it would be worth it for safety from the wolf.</p>
            <p>The day after the oldest pig finished building his house, a wolf came to visit. He first went to the straw house and told the youngest pig that if he didn't let him in, he would huff and puff and blow his house down. The youngest did not let him in and so the wolf blew his house down.
                Next, the wold visited the wooden house. He said the same thing to the middle brother that he did to the youngest brother. The middle brother did not let him in and so he blew his house down too. Finally, the wolf went to the brick house and repeated himself once more to the oldest brother.
                He huffed and puffed but couldnt blow his house down because it was too sturdy. The wolf decided to try and get in through the chimney, but the eldest saw this and lit a fire with a pot of water in the fireplace. The wolf fell in and was boiled. The little brother then decided to work hard 
                from then on and never be lazy again.
